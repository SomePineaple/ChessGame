# ChessButInC

I've been working on this on and off for a while, its a chess engine written in c++, my goal by the end of this project is to have an ai that the player can play against, I'll probably do that using the mini-max algorithm. This is probably my first "large" (in my opinion) project that I've been doing mosty with my own code. You should be able to import this as an eclipse project, I'm using linux, so if you are too just install the SDL2 and SDL2_image dev/lib packeges, and it should work fine. If your on windows IDK how you get the header files into a project, I've watched a few tutorials made in windows, and it seems quite compliacted.
