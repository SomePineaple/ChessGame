# ChessButInC

I've been working on this on and off for a while, its a chess engine written in c++, my goal by the end of this project is to have an ai that the player can play against, I'll probably do that using the mini-max algorithm. This is probably my first "large" (in my opinion) projects that I've been doing mosty with my own code.
